## Activity(apr14th)
1. Run hello-world docker container and observe the container status
 * docker container run -d --name helloworld hello-world
 * docker container ls
 * docker container ls -a
 * docker container run -it -P hello-world
  
2. Check the docker images and also write down the size of hello-world image
   
 * docker image ls

3. Run the nginx container with name as nginx1 and expose it on 8080 port on docker host
 
 * docker container run -d -p 8080:80 --name nginx1 nginx
 * docker container ls -a
  
4. Explain docker container lifecycle
    There are different stages in docker, when we create docker contianers, which is known as Docker container lifecycle
    The stages are
    * Created
    * Running
    * Paused
    * Stopped
    * Deleted

# Create Containers
using docker container create command will create a container with specified docker image
docker container create --name <container name> <imagename>:<tag> preview
here if we observe create command only creates container ,it will not run the container
if we run docker container ls it will not be shown.
if we run docker container ls -a then only it will be shown.
status : is created , not running
# Start Containers
using docker container start command we will start the already created container
docker container start <container name> preview
here the status of container is up and running
if we run docker container ls it will shown
# Run Containers
using docker container run command will do work of both create and start commands
it will create container and also up and running
docker container run -d -P --name <container name> <image name>:<tag> preview
so by using run command : it will create and start the container
# Pause Containers
* docker container pause command use for we will pause the container
docker container pause <container name> preview
* Now i will pause my application loading ,it will be visible in docker container ls
* now we can again run container by using unpause preview
# Stop Container
using docker container stop command we can stop the running container
docker container stop <container name> preview
it will completly stop container
if we want we can again start containe by start command
# Delete Container
using docker container rm we can delete the containers
docker container rm <container name>
from above we can delete container which is stopped, running containers cannot be delete by this preview
running conatiners can be deleted by using force -f option
docker container rm -f <container name>
5. Explain what happens when you run the docker container
when we run docker container
first it will download the docker image from registry or local
and then creates a docker container
and start that container
After creation of container ,it will get
new process tree
disk mount or file system
network -nic
cpu/memory
users
6. Explain the Docker architecture  
  Docker architecture. Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon.
